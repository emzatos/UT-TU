# UT-TU
HackTX 2015 app idea

Allows for party hosts to connect with partygoers. Never again will there be CS majors sitting alone in their dorms on a 
weekend.

Features Facebook sign-in, host / attendee differentiation, creating a party with certain parameters, and (soon) filtering 
parties to find the perfect one.

This product is FAR from complete, but it was a fantastic first attempt at Android Development.
